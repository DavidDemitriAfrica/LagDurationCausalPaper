# LeaderFollowerRelationshipThesis

Code for my paper: Lag and Duration of Leader-Follower Relationships in Mixed Traffic using Causal Inference

R code was written in version 4.2.0, but you may encounter some versioning issues due to the deprecated rinform library which I have manually brought into the file to compute local transfer entropy.
Python code is taken mostly from Petersik's code here: https://github.com/pjpetersik/optimal_velocity_model. It was written in Python 2, so some version issues may be expected on running on your machine. My contribution to the Python code involves the parameter calibration and the objective function (computing RMSE on unequal arrays).
